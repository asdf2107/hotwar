## How to play
* You can place various structures on your land. To capture land just hire a soldier or a tank, clicking on city and then pressing a button in right menu.
* Each turn you get money. Cities give 10$ each, farms - 2$ each. Each soldier or tank cost 1$ to maintain.
* You can repair or delete almost everything (except the landscape).
* Units have health (white bar) and energy (blue bar). Actions take up energy (Attack, hire - 2ðŸ—², move, repair - 1ðŸ—²). Soldiers can move 1 tile vertically or horizontally. Tanks capture more land and can move 2 tiles vertically or horizontally, 1 tile diagonally.
* Water blocks your way - not a problem! Just build a platform.
* The goal is simple - to destroy all enemy's cities.
